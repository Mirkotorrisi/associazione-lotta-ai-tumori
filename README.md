# Associazione Lotta ai Tumori â€“ Website

A public website built with Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript. Content is stored as JSON files under `public/content` and can be edited through a headless CMS (Netlify CMS/Decap) available at `/admin`.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 (configured via PostCSS)
- Radix UI (some components) and lucide-react icons
- Markdown parsing with `marked`
- Netlify CMS (Decap) via CDN to edit content on GitHub

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.18+ or 20+
- npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun (your choice)

## Local development

1. Install dependencies
   - npm install
2. Start the development server
   - npm run dev
3. Visit http://localhost:3000

Available scripts:

- dev: start in development
- build: production build
- start: start the production server (after build)
- lint: code linting

## Main structure

- app/(site)/\*: public pages (home, about, events, news, board, financial report, contacts)
  - app/(site)/eventi/events/[slug]/page.tsx: dynamic event detail page
- app/api/contact/route.ts: POST endpoint for the contact form
- components/site/\*: site-specific UI components (event/news lists, hero, header, footer, etc.)
- components/ui/\*: shared UI components (button, input, textarea, etc.)
- lib/content.ts: loads JSON content and converts Markdown -> HTML
- lib/types.ts: TypeScript types for content (NewsItem, EventItem, ServiceItem, etc.)
- public/content/\*\*: source of editable content
  - public/content/events/index.json
  - public/content/news/index.json
  - public/content/projects/index.json
  - public/content/services/index.json
  - public/content/contacts.json
  - public/content/pages/{about|whatwedo|support|board|report}.json
- public/uploads: image/PDF uploads
- public/admin: CMS panel
  - public/admin/config.yml: CMS configuration (GitHub repository, collections, fields)

## How content works

Content lives in JSON files versioned in Git. During server-side rendering (SSR) they are read from the filesystem (see `lib/content.ts`).

- Events: `public/content/events/index.json` (list of objects with title, slug, date, location, category?, excerpt?, image?, body?)
- News: `public/content/news/index.json` (title, slug, date, excerpt?, image?, body?)
- Services/Projects: their respective `index.json` with basic fields
- Institutional pages: `public/content/pages/*.json` with `body` in Markdown (converted to HTML with `marked`)
- Contacts: `public/content/contacts.json`

Note: `date` fields must be in a format compatible with `new Date(...)`. `slug` values must be unique because they generate dynamic routes.

### CMS (/admin)

- The CMS is served by `/public/admin/index.html` (Netlify CMS via CDN).
- Configuration in `public/admin/config.yml`.
  - Set the GitHub repository: replace `your-username/your-repo` with the real one and the branch (e.g., `main`).
  - `media_folder`: `public/uploads` (files in repo), `public_folder`: `/uploads` (public URL).
  - Publishing mode: `editorial_workflow` (drafts, review, publish).
- After configuring GitHub authentication (via Netlify, Vercel + OAuth app, or another Decap setup), access `/admin` to edit content.

## Routing and rendering

- Home (`app/(site)/page.tsx`): shows services, latest events, and latest news (limited via `getEvents({ limit: 3 })`, `getNews({ limit: 3 })`, `getServices({ limit: 6 })`).
- Events and News (`app/(site)/eventi/page.tsx`): full lists.
- Event detail (`app/(site)/eventi/events/[slug]/page.tsx`): dynamic page generated from event slugs with Markdown body.
- Institutional pages (e.g., About us, Board, Financial report, Support us): content from `public/content/pages/*.json`, converted to HTML via `getPage(...)`.

## Contact form

Endpoint: `POST /api/contact`

- Requires: `{ name: string, email: string, message: string }`
- Current behavior: minimal validation and response `{ ok: true }`.
- For production: integrate an email provider (e.g., SendGrid, Resend) or persist to a DB.

## Styles and UI

- Tailwind CSS v4 enabled via PostCSS (`postcss.config.mjs`).
- Global styles: `app/globals.css`.
- Reusable UI components in `components/ui` and page components in `components/site`.

## Deployment

- Vercel: recommended. Build: `next build`, start: `next start` (automatic on Vercel). The CMS admin is served as a static page at `/admin`.
- Other providers: make sure `/admin` is publicly served and GitHub write access is allowed via OAuth for the CMS.

## Conventions and tips

- Keep fields consistent with `lib/types.ts`.
- Store images/PDFs in `public/uploads` and reference them in JSON (fields `image`/`file`).
- For financial reports, upload PDFs to `public/uploads` and update `public/content/pages/report.json` (list `report`).
- Run `npm run lint` before opening PRs.
